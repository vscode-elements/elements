# How to contribute

Thank you for deciding to contribute to the development of the library.

If you don’t feel confident enough to submit code changes, you can still contribute. Did you find
a typo, grammatical error, or unclear documentation? Improving the documentation is a valuable
contribution as well.

If you’re not yet familiar with the code, we recommend tasks labeled as 
[“good first issue”](https://github.com/vscode-elements/elements/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22). 
These tasks are relatively simple but still important to complete.

If you decide to work on an issue, please indicate it on the issue page to avoid duplication of work.

## Submit a bug report

When submitting a bug report, aim to create a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). It’s perfectly fine if the example is a repository with multiple files, as long as it can be started with a few simple commands (e.g., `npm install && npm run dev`).

## Open a pull request

Before submitting a pull request, ensure the code follows the styling guidelines and is
well-formatted. It’s easier than it sounds—just use the lint and Prettier scripts (see the README).
Writing tests is not required, but we appreciate it if you add tests for new code. If your changes
affect the user-facing functionality, please update the changelog file.
